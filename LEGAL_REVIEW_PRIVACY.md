# Legal Review: Privacy Policy

## Executive Summary

Your Privacy Policy covers basic areas but needs significant expansion to meet modern privacy law requirements (GDPR, CCPA, COPPA). This review identifies gaps and provides recommendations.

---

## ✅ **What's Good**

1. **Basic disclosure structure** - Covers main areas
2. **User rights mentioned** - Access, update, delete
3. **Third-party disclosure** - Mentions Google Maps
4. **Contact information** - Provided

---

## ⚠️ **Critical Issues & Missing Clauses**

### 1. **LAST UPDATED DATE** (MISSING)
**Risk:** Users can't tell if policy is current.

**Recommendation:** Add prominent "Last updated" date at top.

### 2. **DATA RETENTION PERIODS** (CRITICAL - MISSING)
**Risk:** GDPR/CCPA require disclosure of how long data is kept.

**Recommendation:** Add:
```
DATA RETENTION
We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Service and fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When we no longer need your personal information, we will securely delete or anonymize it.
```

### 3. **LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING** (CRITICAL - MISSING)
**Risk:** GDPR requires disclosure of legal basis.

**Recommendation:** Add:
```
LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING
We process your personal information based on:
- Your consent (for marketing communications)
- Performance of a contract (to provide the Service)
- Legitimate interests (to improve our Service)
- Compliance with legal obligations
```

### 4. **COOKIE POLICY** (CRITICAL - MISSING)
**Risk:** Required by GDPR and many jurisdictions.

**Recommendation:** Add:
```
COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on our Service and hold certain information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.
```

### 5. **CHILDREN'S PRIVACY** (CRITICAL - MISSING)
**Risk:** COPPA compliance required.

**Recommendation:** Add:
```
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Our Service is not intended for children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.
```

### 6. **CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS** (CRITICAL - MISSING)
**Risk:** CCPA requires specific disclosures.

**Recommendation:** Add:
```
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
If you are a California resident, you have the right to:
- Know what personal information is collected
- Know if personal information is sold or disclosed
- Opt-out of the sale of personal information
- Access your personal information
- Request deletion of your personal information
- Non-discrimination for exercising your privacy rights
```

### 7. **DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION** (MISSING)
**Risk:** Required by many state laws and GDPR.

**Recommendation:** Add:
```
DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION
In the event of a data breach that compromises your personal information, we will notify you and relevant authorities as required by applicable law, typically within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.
```

### 8. **SPECIFIC THIRD-PARTY DISCLOSURES** (NEEDS EXPANSION)
**Current:** Very vague - "third-party service providers"
**Risk:** Users don't know who has their data.

**Recommendation:** List specific services:
- Airtable (data storage)
- Google Analytics (analytics)
- Google Maps (location services)
- Resend (email services)
- Cloudflare (hosting/CDN)

### 9. **INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS** (MISSING)
**Risk:** GDPR requires disclosure if data leaves EU.

**Recommendation:** Add if applicable:
```
INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws may differ. By using our Service, you consent to the transfer of your information to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this policy.
```

### 10. **SPECIFIC USER RIGHTS** (NEEDS EXPANSION)
**Current:** Very basic
**Recommendation:** Expand to include:
- Right to access
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
- Right to restrict processing
- Right to data portability
- Right to object
- Right to withdraw consent

### 11. **OPT-OUT MECHANISMS** (NEEDS EXPANSION)
**Current:** Mentions email marketing but vague
**Recommendation:** Add specific instructions for:
- Email opt-out
- SMS opt-out (already in Terms)
- Cookie preferences
- Analytics opt-out

### 12. **DATA SECURITY DETAILS** (NEEDS EXPANSION)
**Current:** "Top-notch security measures" - too vague
**Recommendation:** Specify:
- Encryption methods
- Access controls
- Security protocols
- Regular security audits

### 13. **CONTACT EMAIL INCONSISTENCY**
**Line 93:** Says `elombe@swftstudios.com` but Terms say `info@swftstudios.com`
**Fix:** Use consistent email address
